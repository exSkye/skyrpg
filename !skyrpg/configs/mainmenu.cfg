// For each of the KEYs (left side) create a TRANSLATIONS FILE ENTRY.
// Editing the keys or values in this file, other than simply reordering, could potentially
// cause the plugin to stop functioning or produce errors that I will not troubleshoot.
// Please refer to your better judgement before editing.

// Possible config options are: rpg/survivormenu.cfg or rpg/infectedmenu.cfg.
// Talents use the "part of menu named?" key which refers to the left column names to determine
// which sub-menu in-game that they appear under.
// You can add as many options as you want, here. It'll simply create multiple pages in the menu.

// For the "rpg/points.cfg" you can also do the same as with the talent options, by specifying in
// that config what loads where. How cool is that :)


// The Main Menu config has been completely restructured!
// This new structure allows me to create new options so that server operators have more flexibility with
// creating their menu's! It also means that server operator's won't necessarily need to edit the config
/*	just because they want to switch game types!
	New features:

	"config?"	->		Which config does this menu option point to?
	"team?"		->		Which team(s) does this menu display for? 1 (Spectator) 2 (Survivor) 3 (Infected)
	"gamemode?"	->		Which gamemode's are required for this menu to display? 1 (Coop) 2 (Versus) 3 (Survival)
						Please note that the values reflected are based on the gamemode's as defined in the readyup config.
						For "Coop" gamemodes, please refer to "coop game modes?" in your readyup.cfg.
						Any gamemode's not listed in readyup.cfg will result in the menu option not displaying even if
						it's a variant of the required gamemode.
	"flags?"		->		Are specific flags required to view this menu option? If omitted, flags will be ignored.
	"talent dependency?"	->	BE CAREFUL: If you set this to an ability chance, it CANNOT be the ability chance of its own menu, or it'll never appear.
								This allows you to set a talent dependency, so menus can be hidden until certain talents are discovered and/or filled in!

	Please Note***
	If a gamemode is active and not supported, if there are variables specific to it, such as with handicaps, it will automatically set that
	players handicap to disabled. This is great if you, for instance, want only survivors to have access to handicap in a versus game environment.
