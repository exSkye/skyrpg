// You can now mix abilities that rely on percentages (such as slowing abilities) with abilities that rely on base units! Here's the conversion rates:
// If the talent is in units, Under 100.0 units is value * 0.01, Under 1000.0 is value * 0.001, Under 10000.0 is value * 0.0001
// This means if bean bag is 32.0 units / point and a player has 10 points, it's 320.0 total units, so if I have slowing on there as well, slowing will be 0.32 (320.0 * 0.001) @ 32%
