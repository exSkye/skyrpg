// You can have submenu within submenu. I've finally added this feature.
// This means you could have the "weapons" menu option (which opens a submenu because the command has ":" at the start
// and then inside of the "weapons" menu, create a menu submenu, for example, called "other weapons"
// However, it's important to understand that there is no "back" option for these menus, so if you want to create an
// option for players to return to a previous menu, you'll need to manually create that, even if it looks silly, because
// it'd be a duplicate of another option.

// FOR A LIST OF WEAPONS, ETC, SEE: https://wiki.alliedmods.net/Left_4_Dead_2_Weapons

// TEAM DESIGNATIONS: "2" = Survivor "3" = Infected


// MELEE WEAPONS SUPPORT HAS BEEN ADDED
// Melee Weapons Campaigns supported can be found here: http://left4dead.wikia.com/wiki/Weapons
// I've included the fireaxe and cricket bat as examples.
// You must enter the name of any campaigns you want each specific melee weapon to appear in, but they will not work on campaigns
// that they are not inherently supported on.
// For example:
// The fireaxe supports the l4d2 campaigns, minus the parish. However, if I wanted it to only appear on dead center, I would only
// put Dead Center as the value for the campaign supported key. This means if the campaign is not dead center, the fireaxe would
// not show as a purchasable menu item.


// SETTING UP TRANSLATION FILE PROPERLY WITH POINTS.CFG:
// The section name must be in the translations file, case-sensitive. The first section in this config, for example, is weapons.
// The value for description? must also be in the translations file, case-sensitive. The first section, it is weapons bind.
// Failure to do this will most likely cause the menu to not populate properly and/or shoot out other errors.
