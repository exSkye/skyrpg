// Weapon levels increase the amount of damage weapons do - simply by using them.
// Weapon levels can be disabled in the main config. Set "weapon levels enabled?" to "0" (When disabled, it will not show in the main menu)
// In this config, you can set what each level is, along with which weapons it governs.
// I will set a standard system, by default, which is simply a categorization of all weapons.
// NOTE: Weapons must be exclusive to a single category. For instance, you cannot place shotgun_chrome in both "shotguns" and "tier one"
